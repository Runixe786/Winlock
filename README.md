<p align="center"> and 4 more themes you can check by installing the skin.
</p>

# Features
- Clock and date in macOS lockscreen format
- Wifi, battery and power off icons on top right corner like in macOS lockscreen
- 8 lockscreen themes to choose from
- music player integration. 
- shortcut key (alt+L) to activate the skin 
- and some minor details/animations/effects included

# Compatability
<p align="center"> This skin works fine with windows 7 desktops/laptops/pc , having resolution of 1920x1080. For other resolution devices, you may have to adjust some parameters

# How to Setup
- First install the rmskin file given in releases tab
- After that, go to following path: C:\Users\username\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\Screensaver\@Resources . There you will find a file called MacifiedWindows.exe. This is the AHK script converted to exe file to run the shortcut key function of Alt+L to load the skin (just like default lockscreen key is win+L, so i assigned my skin a hotkey too) 
- Now the skin is loaded. you might see some elements not alligned properly if your device isnt compatible with the skin (read compatability above). For that you have to go down and read Fix issues section
- If they are alligned well, you can head forward
- To open themes section, click on button of change wallpaper which will give you 8 themes to select. choose any
- To keep your own wallpaper of skin, edit the [backgroundmeter] in clock.ini file in notepad. by default its IMG_6966.PNG. Place your wallpaper file in @Resources/Resources folder and then rename the default file with name of your image file you want to set as wallpaper.
- CHanging name and username is also inside the same clock.ini file. If you cant find, press ctrl+F(find in notepad) and search "Sahil" and you will find 2 results. edit them accordingly to your preference. 
- For the profile icon, i have provided 8-10 icons inside @Resources/pfp icons folder. Copy the name of any you like and replace it with default name "IMG_7198.PNG" in clock.ini file (use ctrl+F to find this default name)
- This is it, now the setup is hopefully completed. Raise your issue if any and i will try to solve it for you.

# Fix issues
updating soon, stay tuned.

# Hot Key 
- As told before, macifiedwindows.exe is to assign hotkey to load the skin easily without using the mouse. 
- this file will be inside @Resources folder.
- you can make it run on boot by adding it in startup folder
- to access startup folder, press windows key+R and type shell:startup and press enter. Copy the exe file in the folder which will be opened after pressing enter.
- to stop it, you can end task from task manager

# Credits
credits goes to respective developers whose skins i used and modified, like monterey, lofiroom and menubar skin
and also to my testers for making it possible to find issues and help me make a stable version of this skin.
